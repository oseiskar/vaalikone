# Election compass (finnish _Vaalikone_)

An application for finding a candidate to vote for in an election, based on
similarity of answers to a questionnaire. Instead of answering the entire
questionnaire (which is more traditional application hosted by Finnish media
companies), this app encourages the user to only select a few questions they
care about the most and shows the results in real time.

## Data

An open dataset (CC BY 4.0) from the Finnish newspaper is linked as a
Git submodule. Scripts for parsing it to a form usable by this
web app are also included. It is possible to use this app with other similar
datasets of similar size.
